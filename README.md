Chip's Challenge
================

This is a port of Chip's Challenge, aimed at current versions of windows.  Currently, most features (including a good amount of advanced features) work.  There may be several small bugs in the game logic here and there - I haven't played through the whole thing yet (I'm saving this for last).
